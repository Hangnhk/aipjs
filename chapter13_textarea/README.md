# Chapter 13: Starter code for concurrent editor

This project is starter code for a concurrent editor exercise: can you modify the code so that it will safely report an error message in the event of concurrent modification by two separate users?

Some aspects of the project intentionally violate good design practices to facilitate class discussions.

## Usage instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` to start the server
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
