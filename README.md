# Advanced Internet Programming

## Starter Projects and Examples

This repository contains starter projects and examples for the [Advanced Internet Programming workbook](http://www.benjaminjohnston.com.au/extras/aipjs/workbook/).

These projects have been created for design exercises. As such, these projects have significant design problems. They are not examples of *best practice*.

I encourage you to experiment these projects. What improvements make the code easier to read, faster, more maintainable or more reliable?

Through your own experimentation, you will discover improvements and deep design principles that can be applied not only to Node.js projects but also projects in other programming languages.

Best wishes in your studies!
