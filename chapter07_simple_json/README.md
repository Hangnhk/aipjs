# Chapter 7: JSON single-page application

This project is sample code used for design exercises.

Some aspects of the project intentionally violate good design practices to facilitate class discussions.

## Usage instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` to start the server
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/

You can use `npm run api` to start the API without serving the single page application. This code uses `index.js`, but is primarily intended for illustrative purposes to show the back-end logic without any additional logic to serve the single-page application
