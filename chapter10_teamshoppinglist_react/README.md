# Chapter 10: React team shopping list

This project is sample code used for design exercises. It includes a simplified React project.

Some aspects of the project intentionally violate good design practices to facilitate class discussions.

## Starting

1. `npm install`
2. Ensure that no server is running on port 3000
4. `npm start` to build and start the server on port 3000
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/
6. Optional: use `npm run watch` in another terminal window to automatically rebuild the frontend when any changes are detected in the React code
