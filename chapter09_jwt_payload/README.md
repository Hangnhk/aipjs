# Chapter 9: Demonstration of JWT in cookies

This project is sample code used for design exercises.

Some aspects of the project intentionally violate good design practices to facilitate class discussions.

Note that the authentication logic in this project does not check a username/password. Visiting http://localhost:3000/login is assumed to instantly log in the user.

## Usage instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` to start the server
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/check_login or http://localhost:3000/login

Hint: Check the cookies in your browser's development console.
